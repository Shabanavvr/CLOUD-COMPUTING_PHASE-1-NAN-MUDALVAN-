# CLOUD-COMPUTING_PHASE-1-NAN-MUDALVAN-
The project involves creating a disaster recovery plan using IBM Cloud Virtual Servers. The objective is to safeguard business operations by developing a plan that ensures continuity for an on-premises virtual machine in unforeseen events. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
-->Design Thinking:

Disaster Recovery Strategy: Define the disaster recovery strategy and objectives, including recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).
Backup Configuration: Configure regular backups of the on-premises virtual machine to capture critical data and configurations.
Replication Setup: Implement replication of data and virtual machine images to IBM Cloud Virtual Servers to ensure up-to-date copies.
Recovery Testing: Design and conduct recovery tests to validate the recovery process and guarantee minimal downtime.
Business Continuity: Ensure that the disaster recovery plan aligns with the organization's overall business continuity strategy.

1> DISASTER RECOVERY STRATEGY:
A disaster recovery strategy is a plan that an organization creates to ensure it can continue its critical operations and recover its data and systems in the event of a disaster or unexpected incident. This strategy outlines specific objectives, including Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO), which are crucial components of any disaster recovery plan.

1. Recovery Time Objective (RTO):
   - RTO refers to the maximum acceptable downtime for a system or application after a disaster occurs.
   - It defines the amount of time it should take to restore the system or application to a functional state.
   - RTO is measured in hours, minutes, or even seconds, depending on the criticality of the system or application.
   - For example, if a company sets an RTO of 4 hours for its email system, it means that in the event of a disaster, they aim to have their email system up and running within 4 hours.

2. Recovery Point Objective (RPO):
   - RPO defines the maximum amount of data loss that an organization can tolerate in the event of a disaster.
   - It represents the point in time to which data must be restored to resume normal operations.
   - RPO is usually measured in time intervals, such as hours or minutes.
   - For example, if a company sets an RPO of 1 hour for its customer database, it means that they can afford to lose at most 1 hour's worth of data. So, in case of a disaster, they need to recover their database to a state that is no more than 1 hour old.

The disaster recovery strategy aims to align these objectives with the organization's business requirements and priorities. It involves a combination of technical solutions, processes, and procedures to ensure data and systems are protected and can be quickly restored when needed. Common strategies and technologies used for disaster recovery include data backups, off-site data storage, redundant systems, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery testing.

It's essential for organizations to regularly review and update their disaster recovery strategy to ensure it remains effective and aligned with changing business needs and technological advancements. Additionally, testing and simulation of disaster scenarios are critical to verify that the RTO and RPO objectives can be met in real-world situations.

2> Backup Configuration: Configure regular backups of the on-premises virtual machine to capture critical data and configurations :
Configuring regular backups for on-premises virtual machines is essential to ensure data and configurations are protected and can be restored in the event of data loss or system failures. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up a basic backup configuration:

**1. Identify Critical Data and Configurations:**
   - Determine which data and configurations are critical to your organization. This may include databases, application settings, user profiles, and system configurations.

**2. Select Backup Software or Solution:**
   - Choose a backup software or solution that suits your needs. There are various options available, both commercial and open-source, depending on your budget and requirements.

**3. Install and Configure Backup Software:**
   - Install the chosen backup software on the server where your virtual machines are hosted.
   - Follow the software's documentation to configure it properly.
   - Set up authentication and permissions to ensure the backup software has access to the virtual machines.

**4. Create Backup Policies:**
   - Define backup policies that specify what to back up, how often, and where to store backups.
   - Configure the backup schedule to ensure regular backups are taken according to your organization's needs.

**5. Configure Backup Targets:**
   - Determine where you want to store your backups. Common options include:
     - On-premises backup storage (e.g., dedicated backup server, NAS device)
     - Off-site backup storage (e.g., cloud storage, remote data center)
   - Ensure that the selected storage is secure and reliable.

**6. Perform Initial Backup:**
   - Start by performing an initial full backup of the virtual machines. This will create a baseline backup of your data and configurations.

**7. Set Up Incremental or Differential Backups:**
   - After the initial full backup, configure incremental or differential backups to capture changes since the last backup.
   - Incremental backups only store changes made since the last backup, while differential backups store changes made since the last full backup.

**8. Test Restores:**
   - Regularly test the restore process to ensure that you can recover data and configurations successfully. This step is crucial to verify the effectiveness of your backup solution.

**9. Monitor Backup Jobs:**
   - Implement monitoring and alerting to keep track of the status of your backup jobs. This will help you identify and address any issues promptly.

**10. Maintain Backup Software and Hardware:**
   - Keep your backup software and hardware up to date with the latest patches and updates.
   - Periodically review and revise your backup policies to ensure they align with changing business needs.

**11. Document Backup Procedures:**
   - Document your backup procedures and configurations, including contact information for responsible personnel in case of emergencies.

**12. Disaster Recovery Plan:**
   - Integrate your backup strategy into a broader disaster recovery plan that outlines how you will recover in the event of a disaster.

Remember that backup and recovery are critical components of your overall data protection strategy. Regularly revisit and test your backup configuration to ensure it meets your recovery objectives and safeguards your critical data and configurations effectively.
